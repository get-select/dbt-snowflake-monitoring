models:
  - name: daily_rates
    description: >
      A copy of snowflake.organization_usage.rate_sheet_daily for the current Snowflake account, with missing dates imputed.
      This model accounts for the fact that multiple rates will appear on a given day when the account is in overage. This
      happens for on-demand accounts, or fixed contract accounts who have exceeded their remaining balance. When the account
      is in overage, the usage_type will appear as 'compute' (instead of 'overage-compute'), but the effective_rate will be
      the one associated with `overage-compute`. You can identify these instances using `is_overage_rate` to help understand
      why a rate may have suddenly changed.
