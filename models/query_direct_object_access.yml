models:
  - name: query_direct_object_access
    description: This model tracks the objects directly accessed by a query. It contains 1 row per query per object. An object can be a regular table owned/created by your account, a table from a data share, a secured view, or an external table. See https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/access_history.html for more details. Access history is only available for Snowflake accounts on enterprise or higher, and therefore this model will be empty for standard accounts. See https://select.dev/posts/snowflake-unused-tables#direct-versus-base-objects-accessed for more details on the difference between base versus direct tables accessed.
