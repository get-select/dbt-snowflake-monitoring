# Introduction

The following sample queries are useful starting points for performing analysis on top of the models provided by this package. Before running the queries, make sure that the default database and schema have been set:

```sql
use database [dbt-snowflake-monitoring model database]
use schema [dbt-snowflake-monitoring model schema]
```

# Sample Queries

## Reproducing the Monthly Snowflake Invoice
The `daily_spend` model reproduces the monthly Snowflake invoice precisely, broken down by the same service categories. The `daily_spend` model contains additional columns for `warehouse_name`, `database_name` and `storage_type` to further break down spend (see more examples below).

```sql
select
    date_trunc(month, date)::date as month,
    service,
    sum(spend)
from daily_spend
group by 1, 2
```

## Warehouse Costs

### Monthly Spend per Warehouse
This query uses the `daily_spend` model to explore spend by warehouse name. Some queries don't require a running warehouse, which is why you'll see a row for `warehouse_name` = 'Cloud Services Only'.

```sql
select
    date_trunc(month, date)::date as month,
    service,
    warehouse_name,
    sum(spend)
from daily_spend
where service in ('Compute', 'Cloud Services', 'Adj For Incl Cloud Services')
group by 1, 2, 3
```

## Storage Costs

### Monthly Spend per Database
This query uses the `daily_spend` model to explore table spend by database. Note that this also returns storage costs for data held in stages (user and table stages or internal named stages), see the `storage_type` column.

```sql
select
    date_trunc(month, date)::date as month,
    service,
    storage_type,
    database_name,
    sum(spend)
from daily_spend
where service in ('Storage')
group by 1, 2, 3, 4
```

## Storage Costs

### Monthly Spend per Database
This query uses the `daily_spend` model to explore table spend by database. Note that this also returns storage costs for data held in stages (user and table stages or internal named stages), see the `storage_type` column.

```sql
select
    date_trunc(month, date)::date as month,
    service,
    storage_type,
    database_name,
    sum(spend)
from daily_spend
where service in ('Storage')
group by 1, 2, 3, 4
```

## Query Cost Attribution
Snowflake bills for the number of seconds that a warehouse is running, not by query. Query cost attribution helps understand how queries are contributing to warehouse active time. Removing a query will not reduce the bill by the exact amount attributed to the query if other queries are running at the same time and causing the warehouse to stay active.

Cloud services credits are only billed if they exceed 10% of the compute credit consumption on a given day. The cost per query model accounts for this, but current day values will change up until the end of the day.
