## dbt-snowflake-monitoring 3.0.0 - February 26, 2023
After attempting to use only query comments or query tags in versions 1 and 2, we've learned we actually need both. The reasons for that are:
* The `is_incremental` macro is only available from within the query tag dbt context, and is needed to determine whether a model run is incremental or not.
* Query tags have a maximum character limit of 2000, which is easily exceeded by a list of refs containing more than a few models.

To upgrade from 2.x.x, follow the latest instructions in the [Quickstart](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring#quickstart). The package is still able to process query metadata generated by previous versions of the package, so no data will be lost on upgrade.

### Breaking Changes

- Use query comments and query tags to avoid query tag character limit ([#87](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring/pull/87))

## dbt-snowflake-monitoring 2.0.2 - February 21, 2023

### Fixes

- Use the model database and schema for UDF creation ([#83](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring/pull/83))



## dbt-snowflake-monitoring 2.0.1 - February 17, 2023

### Features

- Add spend_net_cloud_services ([#80](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring/pull/80))



## dbt-snowflake-monitoring 2.0.0 - February 08, 2023
The most significant change in 2.0.0 is using query tags instead of comments to attach dbt metadata to queries. To upgrade from previous versions:

1. Remove the query comment configuration from `dbt_project.yml`
2. Follow the instructions to configure the query tag in the [Quickstart](https://github.com/get-select/dbt-snowflake-monitoring#quickstart).
